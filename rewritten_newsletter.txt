# From Freddie Mercury to Frida Kahlo: The Fascinating World of Species Names 

Have you ever wondered how new species get their names? From ancient philosophers to modern pop stars, the inspirations behind species nomenclature are as diverse as the organisms themselves.

## A History of Namesakes

In the 18th and 19th centuries, many species were named after intellectual figures and political leaders of the time. But as more species were discovered, scientists began looking to unexpected sources for inspiration. 

## The Influence of Pop Culture

Today, you'll find species named after celebrities from all walks of life:

- **Musicians:** David Bowie, Bob Marley, and a surprising number of metal bands like Black Sabbath and Metallica
- **Actors & Activists:** Leonardo DiCaprio and Harrison Ford, recognized for their environmental work
- **Childhood Heroes:** Jim Henson (a frog and sea slug) and Steve Irwin (snail _Crikey steveirwini_)
- **Drag Queens:** The colorful _Opaluma rupaul_ and trilobites named after RuPaul's Drag Race stars

Some names are more literal, like the parasite _Aleiodes shakirae_ (after Shakira's famous hips) or the banjo catfish _Acanthobunocephalus scruggsi_ (honoring Earl Scruggs' unique playing style).

## Reflecting Diversity in Science

Species names also highlight the diversity of the researchers themselves. From civil rights heroes like Fred Korematsu to artists like Frida Kahlo, these namesakes reveal the origins and identities of the scientists behind them.

However, not all names have positive associations. Some species are named after controversial figures, sparking debate about updating nomenclature. But the governing bodies prioritize the consistency of scientific names over moral judgements.

## What Will You Name Your Discovery? 

The next time you spot a new species, let your creativity shine! Choose a name that reflects the incredible diversity of both the natural world and the scientists who study it. The possibilities are endless.
