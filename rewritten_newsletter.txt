# Advancing AI Safety Through Global Collaboration

The rapid pace of progress in artificial intelligence is unlocking tremendous benefits for society - from accelerating scientific breakthroughs to making everyday products more useful and accessible. However, as AI systems become more advanced, we must proactively address the novel safety challenges and risks they could pose.

## Building on the Bletchley Legacy

Last year's groundbreaking AI safety summit at Bletchley Park focused global attention on these critical issues. In the months since:

- New AI Safety Institutes have been established in the US and UK
- An interim International Scientific Report on Advanced AI Safety has been launched 
- Leading AI labs are collaborating on evaluation best practices through the Frontier Model Forum

This week's AI Seoul Summit is an opportunity to build on that momentum. By bringing together experts and policymakers from around the world, we can drive further progress towards a common, global approach to AI safety.

## Towards a Shared Framework

At Google DeepMind, we believe AI governance efforts must keep pace with technological progress. That's why we're:

- Conducting pioneering research to identify and address key safety challenges
- Developing a comprehensive approach to evaluating our most advanced models
- Introducing a Frontier Safety Framework to proactively mitigate severe risks

But no single organization can tackle this alone. We need international collaboration to develop shared standards and best practices around AI evaluations, testing, and risk management. 

The AI summits offer a vital forum to advance this critical work. Over time, they could help establish permanent structures - such as an AI equivalent of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - to inform coordinated global action.

## Unlocking the Benefits of AI

By aligning the global community around a proactive, evidence-based approach to AI safety, we can responsibly accelerate innovation and maximize the benefits of AI for all. 

Let's seize the opportunity of the Seoul Summit to deepen our collaboration and move towards a common framework. Together, we can fulfill the promise of artificial intelligence while safeguarding our shared future.
